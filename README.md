# Quizl

Do you regularly find yourself wasting time watching YouTube or scrolling through TikTok when we should be studying instead?

Do you often take “just one episode” breaks that turn into hours of Netflix?

Have you ever  been unable to remember anything from class no matter how many times you read the material?

Our Solution:
We created Quizl to help with these problems by providing a way for you to monitor and limit your “distracting” app usage while studying, as well as, offering you a way to strengthen your knowledge through personalized quizzes based on your current UCLA courses.
